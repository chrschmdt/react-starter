# React + Tailwind CSS Project Starter

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Usage

The goal of this repo is to provide a starter template for a React project using Tailwind CSS, React Router, and Prettier. It includes some components and pages to get started, as well as a light / dark theme toggler. It is not pretty, but it is a decent start to a React project.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run prettier-watch`

Starts an on-change listener to run Prettier code styler against your code to keep it formatted.

### `npm run start`

Runs the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser. The page will reload when you make changes. You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes. Your app is ready to be deployed!
